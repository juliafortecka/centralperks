<h1> Gym myths everyone should know about! </h1>

  <div class="gym-myths">
    <p> <strong> 1. I have bad genetics </strong> </p>
          <p> Genetics are a favourite scapegoat for people who can't build enough muscle or lose enough fat.Now, genetics can make it easier or harder. Some people have naturally high testosterone levels, which means faster muscle growth and an overall leaner physique. Some people's metabolisms are naturally faster than others, making weight loss an easier endeavor. Genetics also play a role in the shape of your muscles. Not all guys can have that perfect square chest or ridiculous bicep peak, and not all women can have a gravity-defying, round butt. But none of these things are limitations. </p>
<p> <strong> 2. Women should train differently to men </strong> </p>
<p>   It is a myth that if women lift heavy weight they will be bulky. It is incredibly difficult for women to ever reach the point of looking 'bulky', regardless of how hard or often they train. Why? Because the hormone that most directly regulates muscle growth is testosterone, and an average woman's testosterone levels are a mere 5-10% of an average man's. </p>
<p> <strong> 3. The more sets you do the better </strong> </p>
<p> Too many sets can actually lead to overtraining, which not only robs you of muscle growth and makes you feel run-down and lthargic but can actually cause you to loose muscle. Yes, that is correct. Two hours of intense lifting can actually make you shrink and get weaker. </p>
<p> <strong> 4. Sweating more during cardio burns more fat </strong> </p>
<p> Sweating does not mean more fat loss.Any extra weight you lose is simply water, and your body will quickly gain it back once you drink some liquids. Not only does inducing heavy sweating like this not do anything in terms of fat loss, it can cause severe dehydration and even heat stroke </p>
<p> <strong> 5.  I don't have the time/opportunity to maintain a healthy diet or exercise </strong> </p>
<p> This is always a problem of priority, not of time or work or anything else. Consider this: If you eat and train properly, you can make great gains with 2 to 3 hours of exercise per week, and you will never need more than 5 to 6 hours per week. Just about anybody can figure out how to steal 2 to 6 hours per week for their health. Fitting in cardio workouts is especially easy because you don't need a gym or more than 20 or 30 minutes of time, 3 or 4 days per week </p>
