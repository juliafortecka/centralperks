  <p>A lot of us don’t have time to go to the gym! Here are a few quick exercises you can do without visiting the gym! All movement counts, and even little movement is better than doing nothing. The immediate benefits are real; it boosts mood, gives you energy, helps you focus, ease anxiety… you’ll be able to bring much more enthusiasm to your everyday activities by feeling better.</p>
    <p>1. <a href="http://www.laceystonefitness.com/">Lacey Stone</a>, a trainer at Equinox Fitness Club in New York, suggests what she calls the Classic Commuter Crunch, which can be done from the seat of a bus, train, or plane (or a car if you’re not driving.) Start by sitting in a neutral position, with your feet hip-width apart and flat on the floor. "Keeping your shoulders and neck relaxed, contract the lower abdominal muscles," says Stone. "Hold the lower abdominal contraction and engage your upper abs. Gently round the lower back and move your ribcage down toward your hips. Hold the contraction for 8 to 10 seconds, breathing normally, and return to a neutral sitting position. Repeat 8 to 12 times or until muscle fatigue."</p>

      <p>2.	Brush your teeth while strengthening your ankles! Whilst you’re brushing your teeth in the mornings and evenings, simply raise one of your legs for one minute, and then the other one for another minute. This will boost your ankle strength and will also ensure that you brush your teeth for the recommended amount of time (two minutes!)</p>

  <p>3. Vacuum with gusto! Chores can be surprisingly energy-consuming.</p>
      </div>
          <p>4.	Take the stairs going up the tube rather than the escalator, or if you’re on the escalator, have a go at taking the ‘walkers’ route on the left.</p>
          <div>
              <p>5.	Even drivers can get exercise on the road— working the core is a good area to focus on while you’re stuck in traffic. Place your hands against the roof or your car, push up with your arms and squeeze your abs at the same time. Hold for 10 seconds and release. Repeat as many times as you can. The dual action of pressing up with the arms and shoulders and squeezing the core creates a static hold that serves to strengthen the arms, shoulders, back, and core all at the same time.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To go that little bit extra, try lifting one or both legs off the floor to engage your core even more.</p>
              <div>
                <p>6.	Another good exercise for drivers stuck at a traffic light or in motorway traffic is an arm strengthener. Open your driver-side window and, assuming there is no passenger in the seat next to you, straighten both arms to the side. With your left palm up and your right palm down, start to switch your palms from up to down. Your arms are straight out to the side, left palm up right palm down and switch, left palm down right palm up. Do this for sets of 50—it feels easy at first but after 40 or so reps you will start to feel it. Rest for 10 seconds and repeat. Just the action of holding your arms out becomes a challenge and the toning benefits of holding that position and switching the hands is undeniable.</p>
