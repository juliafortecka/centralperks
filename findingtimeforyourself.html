    <h1> Finding time for yourself </h1>
    <p> Our most powerful instrument is attention. Whether we focus it on listening to our inner voices, on observing the sensations in our body,or our breathing, we are harnessing heavy duty help.
      </p>
      <p> <strong> Here are some reflections and exercises for busy people </strong> </p>
      <p> <strong> <i> Day 1. </i> </strong> </p>
        <p> Light a candle this morning as you introduce a momentary pause in your doings to sit quietly. Focus on it as it burns to keep your mind from running hrough the needs and desires of the coming day. Instead, concentrate your attention on the flame and on the energy inside you, the flame of your own Being. Try this for a short time, and then return to your life. As you go into your day, keep the candle's flickering flame in your mind's eye.
        </p>
<p> <i> <strong> Day 2 </strong> </i> </p>
<p>Sitting still can be a powerful reorganizer of your energy in body, mind and heart. We tend to pour ourselves outward, drawn by everything we see, or spend time obsessing on past and future. The discipline of keeping the body quiet and your thoughts focused on the candle helps detach you briefly from the outer world, which attracts your attention like a great magnet. Yet, truly, there is another world within, if you allow it to appear. Sit still several times today, wherever you happen to be, and visualize your Self sitting in front of the candle.</p>

<p> <i> <strong> Day 3 </strong> </i> </p>
<p> If your thoughts and imagination carry you away from the precise moment when you wish to be present to your Self, put on some music and follow the voice and instruments attentively with your thought. At the same time, keep a good part of your attention on your physical presence- the sensation of your body sitting there, butt on the chair or cushion, feet on the floor. Or if your mind won't stop interrupting your intention, count to 100 and back </p>

<p> <i> <strong> Day 4 </strong> </i> </p>
<p> Finally, the Royal Road to practicing your own presence is through paying attention to your breathing. As you follow it, your attention becomes engaged with body and mind simultaneously, inviting a new feeling of your Self to appear. Breathing exercises take many forms. Do some research and experiment with whatever method works best for you. One Zen practice is to count from one to five with each inbreath and outbreath as you bring your wandering thoughts again and again back to the sensation of your breathing Being.</p>

<p> <i> <strong> Day 5 </strong> </i> </p>
<p> Today your focus could be less on queries about what's in front of you and more on exploring your own motives and inner explanations for everything you do. Our minds provide an automatic superficial explanation or excuse for our actions that may not have much to do with the underlying truth of why we think what we think and do what we do. Begin to explore your reasoning. Why are you doing whatever you are involved in at any moment? Don't forget to write down some of the automatic explanations that surge up right away. You'll probably hear them again.</p>
